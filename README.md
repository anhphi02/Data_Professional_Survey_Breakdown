# Data_Professional_Survey_Breakdown

- In this Power BI project, I analyzed a survey of data professionals to gain insights into the current state of the industry. The survey contained responses from data analysts, data scientists, and machine learning engineers, and covered a variety of topics related to their roles and responsibilities, skills, and career development.

- I started by importing the survey data into Power BI and then performed data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure the data was in a usable format. This included removing duplicate responses, handling missing values, and converting categorical variables into numerical ones.

- Next, I designed and executed data analysis dashboards to gain insights into the data. I analyzed the demographics of the survey respondents, their educational backgrounds, and the types of industries and companies they worked in. I also explored their job titles, responsibilities, and skills, and calculated key metrics such as average salaries and job satisfaction ratings.

- To help visualize the data, I used Power BI's built-in visualizations as well as custom visuals from the Power BI marketplace. These visualizations provide a clear picture of the trends and patterns in the data, helping to inform decision-making and policy development related to the data industry.

Overall, this project demonstrates my skills in data analysis, data cleaning, and visualization using Power BI, and shows how these skills can be applied to gain insights into complex real-world problems. The project report highlights the key findings and insights from the data analysis, and provides recommendations for future research and policy development.
